Q.11) list : List is a datatype which can store any value and the values are mutable.It means one can change value.It is denoted by [].
            list1=[10,20,'hello','name']
      tuple: Tuple is a datatype which also stores homogeneous or heterogeneous values but tuples are immutable. One cannot change value once assigned.
             They are denoted by ().
             tup=(13,40,50,50)
      set : Set is a datatype which is similar to tuple and shown as same but set contains unique values.Hence wherever one wants to avoid duplicate values 
            set is used.
            sets=(33,45,68,95)
      dictionary: Dictionary is a data type in which values are stored as a key value pair. One can access the values using .values() and for keys using .keys()
                 They are mutable. Denoted by {}.
             dict={'name':['rohan','akash'],'id':[101,105]}

Q.12) strings are immutable in python.Once written they cannot be changed unlike lists.It is advantage as knowning they are immutable makes it easy at construction 
       time.Fixed and unchanging storage requirements.
       string1='I+Love+Python'
      To replace + with ' ' one can directly use replace function.
      string1.replace('+',' ')
      output: I Love Python
 Q.13) To get unicode code of an single length string ord() function is used.It takes string of length 1 as an input and returns unicode code of that particular 
        string.It is built-in function in python and converts character to integers. Ex. ord('B') is 66 i.e. the unicode code of B is 66.
       To get data type of variable in python type() function is used which returns data type of that variable.
       Ex. a=[10,20,30], b={'d':(10,20)}
          type(a),type(b)
           output: list,dict
 
Q.14) 
def quadratic(a,b,c):
    if a==0:
        print('Invalid input, enter value of A other than zero')
    else:
        print('Quadratic equation is: {}X^2+{}X+{}'.format(a,b,c))
        from math import sqrt
        x1=((-b)+sqrt(b**2-(4*a*c)))/(2*a)
        x2=((-b)-sqrt(b**2-(4*a*c)))/(2*a)
        print('Roots of quadratic equation are: X1={} and X2={}'.format(x1,x2))
Q.15)
def addition():
    n=int(input('Enter value of "n":'))
    add=n*(n+1)/2
    print('Sum of "n" natural numbers is:',int(add))
